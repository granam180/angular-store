# angular-store

Demo of some angularJS skills -- a responsive store based on Minecraft Ocelots, or <em>digital kitties</em>.

I've implemented an <a href="https://github.com/granam180/angular-store/tree/master/angular/angular_custom">angular_custom</a> folder as there is still some work to fix a custom-directive.  I'm told it could be scope related.  Check back soon for that.

You cannot add them to any cart as this is just an example :'(
